						well-being, has a rich history that extends back
						centuries. Although the formal establishment of music
						therapy as a profession occurred in the 20th century,
						there is evidence of therapeutic applications of music
						throughout different historical periods. This includes
						the years 1500 to 1800, a time marked by significant
						developments in music and medicine.
